# FUTURE_CS_02 â€“ Security Alert Monitoring & Incident Response
Future Interns Cybersecurity Internship - Task 2: SOC Monitoring & Incident Response

ðŸ“Œ About
This project was completed as part of the Future Interns Cybersecurity Internship (Task 2).  
The task simulates the daily activities of a Security Operations Center (SOC) team, focusing on monitoring alerts, detecting suspicious activities, and simulating incident response using Splunk SIEM.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Ingest and analyze simulated SOC logs into Splunk.
- Identify suspicious activities such as:
- Multiple failed login attempts (possible brute force).
- Malware detections (Trojan, ransomware, spyware, rootkits).
- Suspicious host activity (IP `203.0.113.77` with login + file access + malware).
- Classify incidents by severity (High, Medium, Low).
- Build Splunk dashboards for monitoring activity.
- Create and configure an automated Splunk alert (brute force detection).
- Document findings in a professional Incident Response Report.

ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Splunk Enterprise Free Trial â€“ SIEM platform.
- SOC_Task2 Sample Logs â€“ Provided dataset.
- Word/PDF â€“ Final report.

ðŸ“‚ Deliverables
- Incident Response Report (Task 2) â€“ Detailed report of findings and remediation.
- Screenshots â€“ Evidence of searches, dashboards, and alerts.
- Classification Tableâ€“ Summary of identified incidents and severity levels.
